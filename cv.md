I am a 3rd year student in the direction of "Applied Informatics" at the Ryazan State Radio Engineering University named after V.F. Utkin.
I am a 3rd year student in the direction of "Applied Informatics" at the Ryazan State Radio Engineering University named after V.F. Utkin. Our group is on the same thread as "Software Engineering", which is why we program a lot in various languages, but these are all the basics. I started looking for what I really liked, and saw myself as a frontend development. I really liked this direction because the result of the work is clearly visible after writing each line code. I re-passed HTML, CSS, studied and learned how to practically use Bootstrap. I learned how to work with Figma at the level of opening layouts and their layout. I am currently actively studying JavaScript. I signed up for this course to learn how to do what I really like, gain knowledge and experience.
I believe that in this course I will learn a lot of new things for myself and become an experienced Frontend developer.
